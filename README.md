I did my own simple problem, Test (whit Pytest) and Solution.

You can see the test in 'TestString.py' file

Problem explanation:

Input: string 's'
Output: A list whit two elements; there must be the index (int datatype) of two first characters found, will be same character and should be next to each other, one lower and other Upper. Don't be careful for the order, if you dont found, will be return --> None

Example 1:

Input: "HeLLohHsoa"
Output:[5,6]

Example 2:
Input: "flaCcioOneLl"
Output:[3,4]


Example 3:
Input: "hasggwqeada"
Output:[None]


Example 4:
Input: "aaaAaaa"
Output:[2,3]

Run in terminal (\TestCase> pytest -cov)
this command will be provide you a percent % of test coverage
